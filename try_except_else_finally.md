## `try-except-else-finally` in Python

In addition to `try` and `finally`, the `try-except-else-finally` construct is another exception handling mechanism available in Python. It provides more fine-grained control over exception handling and code execution.

### Syntax

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    # ...
except ExceptionType1:
    # Exception handling code for ExceptionType1
    # ...
except ExceptionType2:
    # Exception handling code for ExceptionType2
    # ...
else:
    # Code to run when no exceptions occur
    # ...
finally:
    # Code that will be executed regardless of an exception
    # ...
```

### Flow of Execution

1. The code within the `try` block is executed.
2. If an exception occurs, the code execution jumps to the corresponding `except` block that matches the exception type. If no matching `except` block is found, the exception propagates up the call stack.
3. If no exception occurs, the code within the `else` block is executed.
4. Finally, the `finally` block is executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It ensures that critical tasks are completed, such as releasing resources, closing files, etc.

### Usage

- The `try` block encloses the code that might raise an exception.
- The `except` block follows the `try` block and specifies the exception(s) to catch. Multiple `except` blocks can be used to handle different exception types.
- The `else` block is executed when no exceptions occur in the `try` block.
- The `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.

The `try-except-else-finally` construct provides a way to handle exceptions, execute code when no exceptions occur, and ensure cleanup operations are performed reliably.

Example:

```python
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero")
    except TypeError:
        print("Error: Invalid operand type")
    else:
        print("Result:", result)
    finally:
        print("Performing cleanup")
        # Close files, release resources, etc.

divide_numbers(10, 2)  # Output: Result: 5.0 \n Performing cleanup
divide_numbers(10, 0)  # Output: Error: Division by zero \n Performing cleanup
divide_numbers(10, '2')  # Output: Error: Invalid operand type \n Performing cleanup
```

In the example above, the `try` block attempts to perform division. Depending on the input values, different exceptions may occur. The corresponding `except` blocks catch and handle the exceptions. If no exceptions occur, the code within the `else` block is executed, printing the result. The `finally` block is always executed, performing cleanup tasks regardless of the exception outcome.

By utilizing the `try-except-else-finally` construct, you can handle specific exceptions, execute code when no exceptions occur, and ensure cleanup operations are performed reliably.
