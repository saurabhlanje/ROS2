# Differences Between ROS1 and ROS2

ROS2 is the successor to ROS1, and it includes several key differences that make it a more powerful and efficient platform for robotics development. Here are some of the main differences between ROS1 and ROS2:

## Middleware

ROS1 uses the Robot Operating System Network (ROSNet) middleware system, while ROS2 uses the Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware system. DDS is a more powerful and efficient middleware system that provides features such as quality-of-service (QoS) settings, real-time communication, and improved security.

## Language Support

ROS1 primarily supports C++ and Python, while ROS2 supports a wider range of programming languages, including Java and Rust.

## Real-time Capabilities

ROS2 is designed to support real-time systems, which require deterministic behavior and low-latency communication. ROS2 includes features such as deadline and liveliness QoS settings, which enable real-time communication between nodes.

## Performance

ROS2 is generally faster than ROS1, especially for large-scale systems. ROS2 includes features such as zero-copy transport, which enables efficient data transfer between nodes.

## Modularity

ROS2 is more modular than ROS1, which makes it easier to develop and maintain large-scale systems. ROS2 includes features such as a component-based architecture, which enables developers to create reusable and interchangeable software components.

## Tooling

ROS2 includes improved tooling compared to ROS1, including a new command-line interface (CLI) and better integration with development tools such as IDEs and debuggers.

## Quality-of-Service (QoS)

QoS refers to a set of parameters that define the characteristics of a communication channel, including the reliability, latency, and bandwidth of the channel. In ROS2, DDS provides a wide range of QoS settings that can be used to optimize the performance and reliability of the communication channel. QoS is essential for ensuring the reliable and efficient communication between nodes in robotics and distributed systems.

## Zero-copy Transport

Zero-copy transport is a technique used to optimize data transfer between different components in software systems. In ROS2, zero-copy transport is used to optimize the communication between nodes, resulting in faster and more efficient data transfer. Zero-copy transport enables the data to be transferred directly from the source memory to the destination memory without going through an intermediate buffer, providing significant performance benefits.

In conclusion, ROS2 represents a significant improvement over ROS1 in terms of performance, flexibility, and ease-of-use, making it a more powerful and scalable platform for robotics development.



# ROS1 Build vs ROS2 Build

The build system in ROS2 has undergone significant changes compared to ROS1. While ROS1 used the Catkin build system, which was based on CMake, ROS2 uses the Colcon build system, which is a more flexible and powerful build system.

Colcon provides several benefits over Catkin, including:

1. **Better Support for Multiple Languages:** Colcon supports a wide range of programming languages, including C++, Python, Java, and Rust, making it easier to develop ROS2 applications in the language of your choice.

2. **Improved Build Performance:** Colcon has better build performance compared to Catkin, especially for large-scale projects with many dependencies. This is because Colcon supports parallel builds and incremental builds, which can significantly reduce build times.

3. **Better Integration with Development Tools:** Colcon integrates better with popular development tools such as IDEs and debuggers, which makes it easier to develop and debug ROS2 applications.

4. **Easier Cross-Compilation:** Colcon makes it easier to cross-compile ROS2 applications for different hardware platforms, which is important for robotics applications that often require running on different types of hardware.

In summary, while ROS1 used the Catkin build system, which was based on CMake, ROS2 uses the Colcon build system, which provides several benefits over Catkin, including better support for multiple languages, improved build performance, better integration with development tools, and easier cross-compilation.

## ROS1 Client Libraries

ROS1 client libraries are primarily developed in C++ with a standalone Python client library called `rospy`. While ROS1 has support for other programming languages, they are less well supported than C++ and Python. 

The ROS1 Python client library (`rospy`) is a standalone client library that is developed independently from the C++ client library (`roscpp`). 

## ROS2 Client Libraries

ROS2 client libraries are primarily developed in C++ with a Python client library called `rclpy`. `rclpy` is built on top of the C++ client library (`rclcpp`) using a language binding, providing better performance and consistency between different programming languages.

By developing the ROS2 client libraries in a modular and language-independent way, ROS2 is able to support multiple programming languages with better consistency across all languages. This approach enables the development of ROS2 applications in a variety of programming languages while still maintaining the performance benefits of C++.

In summary, while ROS1 has standalone client libraries for C++ and Python, ROS2 primarily relies on C++ as the primary development language, with a Python client library built on top of the C++ client library. By taking a modular and language-independent approach, ROS2 is able to better support multiple programming languages while maintaining performance and consistency across all languages.

Comparison between ROS1 and ROS2 with respect to embedded systems:

| **Comparison Criteria** | **ROS1** | **ROS2** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Support for microcontroller architectures | Limited support | Better support through the use of Micro XRCE-DDS protocol |
| Performance and overhead | Higher overhead | Improved performance and reduced overhead through the use of DDS middleware |
| Modularity and scalability | Limited modularity and scalability | More modular and scalable |
| Footprint and resource requirements | Larger footprint and higher resource requirements | Smaller footprint and lower resource requirements |

1. **Support for microcontroller architectures:** ROS2 has better support for microcontroller architectures such as ARM Cortex-M and RISC-V, which are commonly used in embedded systems. This is achieved through the use of the Micro XRCE-DDS protocol, which is a lightweight and efficient data distribution protocol that is specifically designed for resource-constrained systems. ROS1, on the other hand, has limited support for microcontroller architectures.

2. **Improved performance and reduced overhead:** ROS2 has improved performance and reduced overhead compared to ROS1, which makes it more suitable for resource-constrained systems like embedded computers. ROS2 uses the DDS (Data Distribution Service) middleware to provide efficient and reliable communication between nodes, while ROS1 uses a custom TCPROS protocol, which has higher overhead.

3. **Modularity and scalability:** ROS2 is designed to be more modular and scalable than ROS1. This means that ROS2 can be customized to meet the specific needs of different embedded systems. ROS2 provides a set of building blocks that can be combined to create custom middleware solutions that are tailored to the specific requirements of each system. This modularity and scalability is important for embedded systems, which often have unique hardware and software constraints.

4. **Small footprint and lower resource requirements:** ROS2 has a smaller footprint and lower resource requirements compared to ROS1. This makes it more suitable for embedded systems with limited memory and processing power. ROS2 is designed to be lightweight and efficient, and it uses a smaller set of core libraries compared to ROS1.

Overall, ROS2 provides better support for embedded systems compared to ROS1 thanks to its support for microcontroller architectures, improved performance and reduced overhead, modularity and scalability, and smaller footprint and lower resource requirements.
